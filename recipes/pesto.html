        One of my favorite things about summer is the bounty of fresh 
        herbs that are just outside my doorstep. Fresh herbs make any 
        meal instantly more flavorful and beautiful. My favorite thing 
        to do with all of those fresh herbs (aside from sprinkle them 
        on everything) is to make pesto! It’s especially great for lazy
        summertime cooking. I like to dollop it on grilled vegetables, 
        pasta, spaghetti squash, salads, eggs, toasted bread, pizza, 
        sandwiches… you get the idea. With just a few easy steps, it 
        makes anything an instant tasty meal, whether you feel like 
        cooking or not.
